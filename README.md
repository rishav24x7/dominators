This android application was made for one of the problem statements in OpenGovData hackathon in 2017. This app allows an individual to search hospitals and bloodbanks in his/her
closest proximity and the path to that hospital. Also gives one a choice to select between government and private hospitals. We have used google maps api for searching hospitals
bloodbanks.
